# Contributing to v9

Thank you for considering contributing to the v9 project. Your contributions help us improve and maintain our software. To get started, please follow the guidelines below.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: You can start by forking this repository. (Please use `development` as your base branch) This will create a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Branch**: It's important to work in a dedicated branch for your changes. Branch names should follow this structure:

   ```
   <type>/<issue>/<subject>

   Examples:
   - feature/#12/add-ping-command
   - fix/#43/fix-ping-command

   ```

3. **Contribute**: Make your changes in your dedicated branch and commit your work regularly.
4. **Create a Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, create a pull request to merge your branch into the `development` branch. The `development` branch will be merged into `production` when we're ready to release a new version.

## Coding Standards

To maintain consistency and code quality, please adhere to the following coding standards:

- **Formatting**: We use `prettier` formatting rules, defined in the `.prettierrc` file.

- **Linting**: Follow the project's `eslint` rules, which are defined in the `.eslintrc` file.

- **Error Handling**: Ensure that promises rejection is always handled, even if you are confident they will not be rejected.

## Localization Guidelines
### i18next
We're using namespaces to seperate usecases (Commands, Utilities, Environments, ...). For any word separation, we use snake_case. For Categories we use decimals as separation.

Key categories will always be named in a singular form. (e.g. button.x instead of buttons.x)

```diff
// These are valid keys. //
// namespace: global
+  ok
+  dismiss

// namespace: level_command
+  title.required_xp
+  subtitle.required_xp

// These are invalid keys. //
-  global.button.ok
-  form.title_createList
-  global.title.create-list
```

### Command Localization Guidelines
> **Attention**: These guidelines have to be followed to the letter. Otherwise, command localization might break and your pull request will be rejected.

- Every command has to have a namespace. The namespace is the command name in snake_case followed by `_command`. (e.g. set_xp_command, party_command, ...)
- Every command's namespace, has to have the following keys:
  - `command_info.name`
  - `command_info.description`
- If the command has options/values, these have to be named as follows:
  - `command_info.option.<option_name>.name`
  - `command_info.option.<option_name>.description`
  - If the option has choice restrictions, these have to be named as follows:
    - `command_info.option.<option_name>.choice.<choice_name>`
  > Please be aware that these translations will be seamlessly implemented through automated processes. Our advanced command registration system simplifies the management of translations in your code. Simply specify the command's name and any optional settings you may wish to include, and you can essentially eliminate the need for manual intervention in the translation process.  
  > Example:  
  > ```ts
  > export default new Command(
  >   {
  >    name: 'setstreak',
  >    options: [
  >      {
  >        name: 'user',
  >        required: true,
  >        type: CommandOptionType.USER,
  >      },
  >      {
  >        name: 'type',
  >        required: true,
  >        type: CommandOptionType.STRING,
  >        choices: [ // Choices are optional. (They are also only available on string options)
  >          {
  >            name: 'daily',
  >          },
  >          {
  >            name: 'trivia',
  >          },
  >        ],
  >      },
  >    ],
  >   },
  >   execute,
  > );
  > ```

### Global Namespace

The global namespace is intended to be used for very generic translations or strings that can and will be used everywhere without context.

> E.g. title.success in namespace set_xp_command, button.join in namespace party_command, ok in namespace global, ...

## Pull Requests

1. **Link to an Issue**: Every pull request should be linked to an existing issue. If there's no relevant issue, please create one before submitting your pull request.

2. **Detailed Description**: Provide a detailed description of your changes and explain why you made them. Each pull request should focus on one feature or bugfix.

3. **Small Pull Requests**: Keep your pull requests as small as possible. This makes it easier to review and merge changes.

## Contributing Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions are accepted:

- Follow coding standards and handle promise rejections.
- Link your pull request to an issue.
- Provide a clear and detailed description of your changes.

> **Note**: Pull requests that do not follow these guidelines will be rejected.
